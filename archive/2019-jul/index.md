## Reflections, Improvements to be made
* Need fresh Jeopardy questions (were using the same as last month) and clearer explanation of the rules up-front to let participants focus on the Node.
* Want more presentations by newcomers to the group and to Node, even if the topics are basic or mistakes are made. Hoping to encourage group projects (if common interests can be found) and open source contributions.
