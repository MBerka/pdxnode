## Building a serverless framework

BAM! is a serverless framework designed to mitigate some of the challenges faced
when working with Amazon Web Services (AWS).  It is optimized for the deployment
of AWS Lambda functions integrated with Amazon API Gateway endpoints.

This presentation will discuss the landscape surrounding serverless
technologies, the challenges of working with AWS, and design choices made when
building a serverless framework.

Topics included:

* `Serverless` - an overview of how serverless technologies fit into the current
  landscape
* `AWS Lambda` - FaaS, in general, and AWS Lambda specifically
* `Amazon API Gateway` - integration of lambdas with gateway endpoints
* `Serverless frameworks` - a comparison of existing serverless frameworks
