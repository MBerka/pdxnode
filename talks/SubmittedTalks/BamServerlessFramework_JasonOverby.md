## Building a serverless framework

BAM! is a serverless framework that makes it quick (hence, the name) and easy to
get small applications up and running using Node.js and Amazon Web Services
(AWS). It is optimized for the deployment of AWS Lambda functions integrated
with Amazon API Gateway endpoints, but also allows for the creation of Amazon
DynamoDB tables, which can be used to persist data between lambda invocations.

This presentation will discuss the landscape surrounding serverless
technologies, the challenges of working with AWS, and design choices made for
BAM!

Topics included:

* `Serverless` - an overview of how serverless technologies fit into the current
  landscape
* `AWS Lambda` - FaaS, in general, and AWS Lambda specifically
* `Amazon API Gateway` - integration of lambdas with gateway endpoints
* `Serverless frameworks` - a comparison of existing serverless frameworks
