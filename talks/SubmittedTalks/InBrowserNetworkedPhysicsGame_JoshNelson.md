## Building an In-Browser, Networked Physics Game

Making a game is simple, right? 

How about adding physics to it? What if we ran it in the browser and made it a real-time multiplayer? 

I think you can see that very quickly what was once a straightforward challenge has ballooned into a much more signifcant undertaking. The browser is not a particularly friendly environment for multiplayer games, especially those that need to be responsive and real-time.

This presentation will walk us through core challenges that every developer will face when trying to make an in-browser game and how they can overcome them. Josh will highlight key concepts and solutions using a game he recently built in Node and React as an example, PlinkoJS. 

The following core topics will be covered: 

* `Games in the browser` - The building blocks for a local, in-browser game
* `Network architecture` - Connecting players over the internet
* `State synchronization` - Creating and maintaining an authoritative game state
* `Optimizations` - Reducing bandwidth and latency estimation
