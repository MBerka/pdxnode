# Talk Submission Template

## BAM!, a lightweight, serverless framework used to quickly build and deploy applications with Node.js and AWS

The BAM! framework is made for humans. Itâ€™s quick. Itâ€™s easy to use. And it allows you to stay focused on your code. Come learn how to deploy an AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway with one command. ðŸ’¥

Check out my Github page [here](https://github.com/jasonoverby).

I have several years experience with a variety of languages and technologies, including Node.js, Ruby, PostgreSQL, React/Redux, and Rails.

I have spent a lot of time with Amazon Web Services, such as Lambda and API Gateway.

I am currently looking for opportunities.

### Submitters

To submit your talk, fork this repository and clone it. Copy this template into your desired talk date's directory as `your_talk_name.md`. Then, edit it to describe your lightning talk! Commit your new file, and push it to your fork, then issue a pull request titled "Talk proposal". Feel free to ping the organizers on Twitter at @pdxnode or in `#nodepdx` on IRC to ensure they see your pull request. If your talk is accepted, it will get merged and the organizers will reach out to you via email.

Your talk will only be considered for the next meetup if it's submitted at least one week in advance, to allow for discussion and deliberation.

### Organizers

Review the talk and the discussion on the pull request before merging. Has this person given good talks in the past? Have they never given a long form talk but have given several lightning talks in the past? How have those talks been received? Emphasis should be given to folks that haven't given a talk before, but have 1-3 lightning talks under their belt.

If you decide to accept the talk, merge the pull request and email the contributor (use the email on their commit) to let them know their talk has been accepted. Plan to reach out to them 3-4 days before their talk to check on them / make sure they're prepared / ask them if they need anything else in preparation for their talk. If a speaker has to cancel, reach out first to the other talk proposals, and in the case that no one is prepared to give a talk on short notice, scheduled extra lightning talks.

After the talk, feel free to edit their talk file to include links to videos, photos, slides, or other relevant links.

If you decide not to accept the talk, but want to consider it for a future meetup, decline the pull request and comment to this effect. Be sure to get specifics from the potential speaker in re: potential meetup dates that'd they'd be able to commit to.

If the talk is unacceptable (for any of the reasons set for the in the code of conduct, or otherwise); close the pull request. Ideally, link to the relevant headers in the code of conduct, or otherwise explain your decision.
