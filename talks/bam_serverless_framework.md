Check out my Github page [here](https://github.com/jasonoverby).

I have several years experience with a variety of languages and technologies, including Node.js, Ruby, PostgreSQL, React/Redux, and Rails.

I have spent a lot of time with Amazon Web Services, such as Lambda and API Gateway.

I am currently looking for opportunities.
